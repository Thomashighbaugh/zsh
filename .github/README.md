# ZSH Configuration 

## Installation 
The provided install.sh script will copy the zshenv file in this directory to the user's home directory where the shell 
expects it, thus providing the location the shell will then load the rest of the configuration from. No additional setup 
is needed as it is done automatically.

## Acknowledgments 
In its present incarnation, this configuration owes its existence to [zsh-launchpad by Marlon Richert](https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-launchpad)
